    <h3>Step 2: Generate the EMF Model Code</h3>
         
    <p>The GenModel shows a root object, representing the the whole
    model.  The model object has children that represent its packages, whose
    children then represent classifiers (classes and datatypes, including
    enumerated types).  The children of classes are class attributes,
    references, and operations; the children of enumerated types are enum
    literals.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The GenModel can be expanded to see its various elements.

        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        There are properties associated with each object.  If the Properties
        view isn't already showing, bring up "Window/Show View/Other..."

          width="378">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        Expand the "Basic" set of views and choose "Properties".
        <br>
        <img src="cg203.gif" alt="Chose Properties" height="164" width="153">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        These properties control the behavior of the code generator.
        <br>
        <img src="cg204.gif" alt="GenModel properties" height="502"
          width="575">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In most cases, the properites need not be changed from their default
    values, but these options can provide a great deal of control over the
    code that gets generated.  This topic will be explored more fully in
    future tutorial material; for now, select several different GenModel
    objects, and observe their properties.</p>

    <p>The GenModel is also the place where you initiate the code generation.
    By right-clicking on an object in the model, you can generate code for
    it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Right-click the "library" model object and
        select "Generate Model Code" from the pop-up menu.
        <br>
        <img src="cg207.gif" alt="Generate Model" height="238" width="213">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        Observe the generated files.
        <br>
        <img src="cg208.gif" alt="Generated model code" height="357"
          width="245">
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>After generation, the class interfaces and enum class will have been
    created (if the model was imported from Rose) or completed (if the model
    was defined using annotated Java), and a new pair of interfaces will have
    been created for the package itself and for the factory.  There will also
    be two new packages, with "impl" and "util" suffixes, which contain
    implementations of the interfaces and additional utility classes, and
    a "plugin.xml" manifest file for the model plugin.</p>

    <p>If you define the model by using annotated Java, after generating code by
    selecting "Generate Model Code" pop-up menu, you will see the warning message
    "The import java.util.List is never used". This message is ok for you to continue
    to work on next step.</p>

    <p>If you change the model, you can regenerate it, and changes will be
    merged with any hand modifications that may have been made to the code.
    You can also selectively generate a subset of the model code by
    right-clicking on a package, class, or enum object and selecting
    "Generate Model Code" from the pop-up menu.</p>
