    <h3>Step 2: Generating the EMF Model Code</h3>
         
    <p>The GenModel shows a root node, representing the whole
    model.  The model object has children that represent its packages, whose
    children then represent classifiers (classes and datatypes, including
    enumerated types).  The children of classes are class attributes,
    references, and operations; the children of enumerated types are enum
    literals.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The GenModel can be expanded to see its various elements.

        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        There are properties associated with each node.  If the Properties
        view isn't already showing, bring up "Window/Show View/Other..."

          width="378">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        Expand the "Basic" set of views and choose "Properties".
        <br>
        <img src="../clibmod/cg203.gif" alt="Chose Properties" height="164" width="153">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        These properties control the behavior of the code generator.
        <br>

          width="518">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In most cases, the values of the properities need not be changed from their default
    values, but these options can provide a great deal of control over the
    code that gets generated.  This topic will be explored more fully in
    future tutorial material; for now, select several different GenModel
    objects, and observe their properties.</p>

    <p>The GenModel is also the place where you initiate the code generation.
    By right-clicking on an object in the model, you can generate code for
    it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Right-click the "library" model object and
        select "Generate Model Code" from the pop-up menu.
        <br>
        <img src="../clibmod/cg207.gif" alt="Generate Model" height="238" width="213">
        <br>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        Observe the generated files.
        <br>
        <img src="xl203.gif" alt="Generated model code" height="340"
          width="246">
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>After generation, the class interfaces and enum class will have been
    created, and a new pair of interfaces will have been created for the package 
    itself and for the factory.  There will also be two new packages, with "impl" 
    and "util" suffixes, which contain implementations of the interfaces and 
    additional utility classes, and a "plugin.xml" manifest file for the model plugin.</p>

    <p>If you change the XML schema file, you can regenerate the model code from it, and 
    the corresponding changes in the model code will be merged with any hand modifications 
    that may have been made to the code that was generated previously. You can also selectively 
    generate a subset of the model code by right-clicking on a package, class, or enum object and selecting
    "Generate Model Code" from the pop-up menu.</p>
