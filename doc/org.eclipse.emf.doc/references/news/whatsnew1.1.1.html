<p>  
There are numerous bug fixes and improvements included with this build, some of which are described below. Where the description applies to a fix for a bug reported through Bugzilla, the Bugzilla number is included after the description.
<br>
&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>
Better JET encoding support has been added. UTF-8 encoded templates are supported now.  
(Bugzilla
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38074">38074</a>,

<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38075">38075</a>,

<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41723">41723</a>)


<li>
The org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jet.JETSkeleton.java class has been changed to generate code with platform-specific linefeeds.
(Bugzilla 
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24371">24371</a>)


<li>
The org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jmerge.JMerger.java class has been changed to accommodate platform-dependent line separator character(s).


<li>
The org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEMap.java class has been updated to fix a recursive cycle bug encountered when using the putEntry(Entry entry, Object value) method to put a new value to an existing key.


<li>
The org.eclipse.emf.common.util.URI.java class has been updated to handle resolution of JAR-scheme URIs. Also, comparison of schemes has been made case-insensitive in all URI operations, including testing equality.


<li>
Changes have been made to handle xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation in XML and XMI instance documents.
(Bugzilla 
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39440">39440</a>)


<li>
The setAttribValue(EObject object, String name, String value) in the org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.impl.XMLHandler.java class has been changed to properly handle qualified attributes.



<li>
The org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui.celleditor.FeatureEditorDialog.java class has been modified to make it more generally useful. A new constructor has been added that enables you to instantiate a FeatureEditorDialog that can be used to edit any set of values that are passed to it during construction, rather than the values of a specified feature of a specified EObject.  The new constructor is used by the createPropertyEditor(Composite composite) method in the org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui.provider.PropertyDescriptor.java class, which fixes a problem that can occur when using an ItemPropertyDescriptorDecorator to customize a multi-valued property.


<li>
Drag and drop for the generated editor has been fixed on Linux. 
(Bugzilla
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39151">39151</a>)


<li>
The next() method in the org.eclipse.emf.common.util.AbstractTreeIterator.java class has been changed so that it doesn't return the root if it's not
supposed to, even if the hasNext() method hasn't been called.

<p>  
There are bug fixes and improvements included with this build, some of which are described below.
Where the description applies to a bug reported through Bugzilla, the Bugzilla number is included after the description.
<br>

&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>
The eBasicSetContainer(InternalEObject newContainer, int newContainerFeatureID, NotificationChain msgs) method in the 
org.eclipse.emf.ecore.impl.EObjectImpl.java class has been changed so that 
eBasicSetContainer(newContainer, newContainerFeatureID) is called before newResource.attached(this). 
(Bugzilla 
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41907">41907</a>)


<li>
The painting problem with the ExtendedTableTreeViewer on Linux-GTK has been fixed.  
(Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39707">39707</a>)


<li>
The version numbers for the plugins in the feature.xml files have been updated to 1.1.1.  
Additionally, in the feature.xml file for the org.eclipse.emf feature, the following updates
have been made in the requires element:


<ul>
  <li>
     in the import element for the org.eclipse.core.resources plugin, the version has been changed to 2.1.1
  
  <li>
    in the import element for the org.apaches.xerces plugin, the version has been changed to 4.0.13

<p>  
There are bug fixes and improvements included with this build, some of which are described below.
Where the description applies to a bug reported through Bugzilla, the Bugzilla number is included after the description.
<br>
&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>
The org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.EcontentAdapter.java class has been improved.  Included are the following changes:
<ul>
<li>REMOVING_ADAPTER notification is now used to remove children recursively.

(Bugzilla 
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=43417">43417</a>)
<li>super.setTarget(target) is now called during the setTarget(Notifier target) method.
(Bugzilla 
<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=43416">43416</a>)
</ul>


<li>
Importing a Rose model containing a reference from a class to another class that is stereotyped <<datatype>> is now supported. Previously, this would result in a ClassCastException.
(Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41993">41993</a>)



<li>
EMF now avoids generating methods that collide with feature methods. 
For example, suppose that you have an interface A, and that A extends an 
interface containing a method with the signature Foo getFoo().  If A also 
has an attribute named foo of type Foo,then the accessor method with the 
signature Foo getFoo() would collide with the method from the parent interface. 
In this case, the generated interface A will contain only one Foo getFoo() 
method.  Further, the implementation of the Foo getFoo() method in the 
generated AImpl.java class will be that for the accessor method.
(Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38602">38602</a>)


<li>
 The package name resolution algorithm in the method resolve(EModelElement eModelElement, 
 String typeName, boolean recordDemandCreatedEDataType) in the org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.JavaEcoreBuilder.java 
 class has been improved. 
(Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=44080">44080</a>)


<li>
 The braceLine attribute in the org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jmerge.JMerger.java class 
 has been changed to escape the brace. 
(Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=45182">45182</a>)



<li>
EMF now throws a PackageNotFoundException if you try to reference a Resource 
that references an unregistered package. 
(Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=43123">43123</a>)


<li>
The resetPropertyValue(Object object) method in the org.eclipse.emf.edit.provider.ItemPropertyDescriptior.java 
class has now been implemented. 
(Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41706">41706</a>)
